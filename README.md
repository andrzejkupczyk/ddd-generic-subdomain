# Domain-Driven Design generics

![PHP requirement](https://img.shields.io/packagist/php-v/andrzejkupczyk/ddd-generic-subdomain?logo=php&style=for-the-badge)

This package provides interfaces that can be used to support coherent implementation of DDD components within your core 
domain. It is intended to be used as an off-the-shelf solution that helps to avoid clogging up a domain model and to 
force members of your team or yourself on thinking in terms of immutable objects and their interaction. 
 

All implementations are inspired by literature, ValueObject library created by [Nicol√≤ Pignatelli](https://github.com/nicolopignatelli), 
[SeedStack](http://seedstack.org) Java development stack, [ValueObjects toolkit](https://github.com/barryosull/valueobjects)
 and some other, more direct sources, but mainly by my experiences and needs.
